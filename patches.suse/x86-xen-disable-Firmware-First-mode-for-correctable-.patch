Subject: [PATCH] x86/xen: disable Firmware First mode for correctable memory
 errors

When running as Xen dom0 the kernel isn't responsible for selecting the
error handling mode, this should be handled by the hypervisor.

So disable setting FF mode when running as Xen pv guest. Not doing so
might result in boot splats like:

[    7.509696] HEST: Enabling Firmware First mode for corrected errors.
[    7.510382] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 2.
[    7.510383] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 3.
[    7.510384] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 4.
[    7.510384] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 5.
[    7.510385] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 6.
[    7.510386] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 7.
[    7.510386] mce: [Firmware Bug]: Ignoring request to disable invalid MCA bank 8.

Reason is that the HEST ACPI table contains the real number of MCA
banks, while the hypervisor is emulating only 2 banks for guests.
