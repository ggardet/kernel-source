A new warning in Clang points out that the initialization of
mux_pll_src_4plls_p appears incorrect:

../drivers/clk/rockchip/clk-rk3228.c:140:58: warning: suspicious
concatenation of string literals in an array initialization; did you
mean to separate the elements with a comma? [-Wstring-concatenation]
PNAME(mux_pll_src_4plls_p)      = { "cpll", "gpll", "hdmiphy" "usb480m" };
                                                              ^
                                                             ,
../drivers/clk/rockchip/clk-rk3228.c:140:48: note: place parentheses
around the string literal to silence warning
PNAME(mux_pll_src_4plls_p)      = { "cpll", "gpll", "hdmiphy" "usb480m" };
                                                    ^
1 warning generated.

Given the name of the variable and the same variable name in rv1108, it
seems that this should have been four distinct elements. Fix it up by
adding the comma as suggested.
