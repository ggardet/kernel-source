Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix flags argument to rmap lookup when converting shared
 file rmaps
Git-commit: ea8439899c0b15a176664df62aff928010fad276
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc4
References: git-fixes

Pass the same oldext argument (which contains the existing rmapping's
unwritten state) to xfs_rmap_lookup_le_range at the start of
xfs_rmap_convert_shared.  At this point in the code, flags is zero,
which means that we perform lookups using the wrong key.

Fixes: 3f165b334e51 ("xfs: convert unwritten status of reverse mappings for shared files")
